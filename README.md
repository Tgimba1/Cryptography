# Cryptography
This project has a sole aim of allowing users from both ends to encrypt and decrypt messages using a secret key(Symmetri Encryption)
With the use of my algorithm to encrypt data, the messaging app rearranges the order of the app so that it cannot be understood. It does this by working out which letters are in even or odds positions. Then it swaps the position of each pair of letters in the message, starting with the first two, then the next two, and so on. The program also makes encrypted messages readable again by stitching the letters back to where they started.
